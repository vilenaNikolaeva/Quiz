This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
### Project Description:

React js and Next.js application designed for a quiz that has questions with a maximum of 4 possible choices. The user can answer a question and seamlessly go to the next question after clicking a choice. If the user isnâ€™t able to answer a question on time, the quiz will proceed with the next question after the red progress bar time indicates the end.
